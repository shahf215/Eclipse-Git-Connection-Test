% Task 1: Multiply the numbers 3 and 5 with the command
3*5;

% Task 2: Assign the result of 3*5 to a variable named m:
m = 3*5;

% Task 3: Enter the command m = m + 1 to see what happens.
m = m + 1;

% Task 4: Create a variable named y that has the value of m/2
y = m/2;

% Task 5: Enter k = 8 - 2; including the semicolon at the end.
k = 8 - 2;

% Task 6: Press the Up arrow key to return to the command m = 3*5, and before pressing Enter, edit the command to be m = 3*k.
m = 3*k;

% Task 7: In Task 4, you calculated the value of y using the value of m. Was y recalculated when you modified m in Task 6?
y;
